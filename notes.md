## Naming Things

When creating a postgres database in Azure it is very important to get the username, password, and server name set to something that is valid. The server name should be something reasonably descriptive and long enough to not get the creation code confused. In addition the password should be I believe 8+ characters with some special characters and upper case and lower case. The server name, database name, and those parameters however should NOT include special characters and NOT include upper case charactrs.
